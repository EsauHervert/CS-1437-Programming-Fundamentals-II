Test 1.
=============================================================================
This program will calculate the estimated age of a sample using Carbon-14.
The formula to be used will be:

t = (T / ln(2) * ln(1 + D / P))

Where:
t       -  age of the sample in years
T       -  half-life of Carbon-14 ,5730 years
ln      -  natural logarithm
D       -  amount of Carbon-14 in a given dead sample
P       -  amount of Carbon-14 in a living species today

Please enter the ratio D / P: .5

The approximate age of this sample is: 3351.84 years

would you like to calculate a different sample?

Enter y for yes and n for no.
